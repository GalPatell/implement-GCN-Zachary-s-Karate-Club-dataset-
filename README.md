# Implement-GCN-Zachary-s-Karate-Club-dataset-
Implementation of several GCN variants to classify nodes in the Zacharyâ€™s Karate Club dataset. We explored hyperparameter optimization, different layer depths, and custom GCN variations to analyze model performance.
Using PyTorch Geometric, we modified the message passing framework, experimenting with 2-5 layers and various aggregation functions to understand their impact on classification.

Requirements: pip install torch torch-geometric numpy matplotlib
Run: python main.py

We used AI tools such as codo, copilot and ChatGPT to enhance efficiency by refining code structure, generating small utility methods, and assisting in test case design.
